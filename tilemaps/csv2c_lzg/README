This program fills the niche of CSV2C.py, but it compresses the data using liblzg before outputting it.
Castle Escape uses liblzg to compress level data.

You will (probably) need to compile liblzg yourself before you can compile this. 
You can just navigate to the ./lib folder in this directory and run `make` to do so.
Then, compile `csv2c_lzg` by running `make` in this directory.

If you're using this in your CC65 NES game, be sure to also use the liblzg decompressor. 
A version of it I modified to work with cc65 can be found in the /lib folder of the Castle Escape repository.
